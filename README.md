# Project for learning go - One Time Secret

This project is loosely based on my [Non-Disclosure-Agreement](https://github.com/danmanners/non-disclosure-agreement) Python project, but written in Go.

## To-Do

- [ ] Add in Multiple User-Selectable Backends
  - [ ] Redis
  - [ ] etcd
- [ ] Encrypt _literally_ anything; shit isn't even encoded.
